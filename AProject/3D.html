            <h3>What is Video Game Design?</h3>
            <p>First and foremost, it is really important that you get an idea of what a video game design is and how does it work in the development of 3D games. 
                Video game design refers to the planning, designing and creation of the video games. Video game designers often work as a team and closely to develop a video game, which can be played on different devices like PC and gaming consoles like Xbox.</p>
                <p>Although being a 3D video game designer may sound like a dream come true, it is a hard job to accomplish. Opposite to the false notion that video games are created overnight or in some weeks, it takes developers years to plan a game and develop it. Extensive tests are carried out on each development before releasing it out in the market. </p>
